Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and
maintenance of software.It involves the application of engineering principles to software creation, 
ensuring that the software is reliable, efficient, and meets the needs of users.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Planning: Defining the project scope, objectives, and feasibility.
Analysis: Detailed requirement gathering and analysis.
Design: System and software design based on requirements.
Implementation: Coding and developing the software.
Testing: Verifying the software meets requirements and is bug-free.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance: Ongoing support and evolution of the software.

Comparison: Agile vs. Waterfall
Flexibility:
Waterfall: Inflexible, with fixed requirements and a linear progression.
Agile: Highly flexible, allowing for changes in requirements even late in the project.
Customer Involvement:
Waterfall: Limited to initial requirements gathering and final delivery.
Agile: Continuous involvement throughout the development process.
Risk Management:
Waterfall: Higher risk due to late testing and difficulty in handling changes.
Agile: Lower risk with regular testing, feedback, and iterative improvements.
Project Size and Complexity:
Waterfall: Suited for smaller, well-defined projects with clear requirements.
Agile: Better for complex, evolving projects where requirements may change.
Documentation:
Waterfall: Extensive documentation throughout each phase.
Agile: Minimal documentation, focusing more on working software and collaboration.
